JavaScript Callback & Asynchronous Practice

This repository contains practice examples for understanding JavaScript functions, callbacks, and asynchronous behavior using setTimeout.

Topics Covered

Function expressions and arrow functions

Function hoisting

Higher-order functions

Passing functions as callbacks

setTimeout usage with and without parameters

Callback chaining (Callback Hell)

Asynchronous execution flow

Purpose

The goal of this project is to understand:

How callbacks store the next function to execute

How asynchronous JavaScript works

How to manage sequential operations using nested callbacks

Output

When run, the code demonstrates sequential asynchronous execution and callback chaining.

Learning Outcomes

Understanding how callbacks control execution order

Learning the difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution

Preparing for advanced topics like Promises and async/await

Do you want me to also make it one-liner super concise version for GitHub projects?
